        <h3>What's PbtA??</h3>
        <p>
          PbtA stands for Powered by the Apocalypse. It is named after its progenitor, a rpg game taking place in a post-apocalyptic world with a focus on the players.
          <br><br>
          Powered by the Apocalypse games are centered on resolving what characters do as Moves. Characters have access to a default selection of moves based on the 
          expectations of the game setting. Moves are resolved by rolling 2d6s. A 6- result is a miss, 7-9 is a mixed success, and 10+ is a complete success.
          <br><br>
          With the use of Moves the players are in charge of the story and help move it forward. The Game Master's (GM) job is to simply react to the players' choices.
