        <p>
          Lines and veils is a safety tool that originally appeared in the Sex and Sorcery supplement for 
          Ron Edwards' Sorcerer. Lines and veils lets players flag up content that they don't want to appear 
          in a game at all (lines) and content that can appear but should be handled sensitively or off-screen (veiled).

        <h1 style="color: #FCD757">Safety Tools</h1>
        <p>
          When playing any game, always remember that people come to the table with their
          own experiences, traumas, and perceptions. Make a habit of requesting or seeking
          consent for things that may be uncomfortable. Sometimes, content enters a game
          that causes problems for players at the table despite everyone's best intentions. We
          therefore suggest using the safety toolkit Script Change by Brie Beau Sheldon to
          manage discussions around tone or content in your game.

        <h3>Pause</h3>
        <p>
          the game and take a break from an intense scene, or to discuss or clarify what
          is happening in the story.
        </p>

        <h3>Rewind</h3>
        <p>
          the story back to a point before a piece of content entered the story. The group 
          can then narrate a different course of action to avoid the thing that cause the rewind.
        </p>

        <h3>Fast-Forward</h3>
        <p>
          over something they don't want to dwell on in the story, or to simply move time forward.
        </p>

        <h3>Frame-by-Frame</h3>
        <p>
          through a scene they want to approach with care. This slows the story down so everyone 
          can pause where needed and check in with each other.
        </p>
